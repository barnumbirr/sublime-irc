Thank you for installing sublime-irc, an IRC log file syntax highlighter for
Sublime Text.

You're almost there, you'll only need to close and reopen all IRC related
files (.txt, .log ...) and select the 'IRC' syntax from the menu.

If you have any questions, comments, concerns, bugs, or patches, please open an
issue or pull request over on GitHub (https://github.com/barnumbirr/sublime-irc).
You can also find me on Twitter @barnumbirr.
