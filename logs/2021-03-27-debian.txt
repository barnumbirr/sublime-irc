02:14 <Yash>  is it advisable for production usage?
02:15 <diogenes_oftc> Yash, i'd not recommend anything lenovo related to anything Linux related.
02:17 <Yash>  any server hardware provider which supports Debian 10 out of the box?
02:18 <Yash>  i have checked dell, lenovo, hp & supermicro
02:18 <Yash>  i can not see debian 10 in compatible os list

07:33 <filePeter> While I could fix it, with removing another kernel, is there a method to change this behavior? (tmpfs, different installation path?)
07:33 <filePeter> rudi_s: Thank you. Yes this is what made it work in the end.
07:33 <grawity>   I'm not sure a tmpfs would help if the end result is unable to fit in /boot anyway?

08:59 <grove> You look in ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

09:00 <grawity>   to make sure they're indeed connecting to the same destination
09:01 <ottavio>   ~/.ssh/authorized_keys are the clinet keys or the server keys?
09:01 <grawity>   that's a file the server looks in
09:02 <grawity>   so it's on the server, but it contains client public keys, of course
09:02 <ottavio>   shouldn't that be /etc/ssh/* something?

09:05 <grawity>   wait, "still" asking for a password?
09:05 <grawity>   a while earlier you said it was timing out before it got to that point
09:05 <grove> If the different amount of x's indicate that the hostnames given to the commands are different, that's your explanation, different hostnames might cause different lookups in your .ssh/config (on the client) and that might in turn cause all kinds of weird behaviour
09:05 <ottavio>   Yes, I've done this a million times but only for this local machine it's not working.
09:05 <ottavio>   grove: no this was just a bad edit of mine.
09:05 <grawity>   in that case, edit the *server's* /etc/ssh/sshd_config to have 'LogLevel DEBUG2', restart sshd, then check the server-side system logs
09:06 <grawity>   it'll tell you why the keys are being ignored etc
09:06 <grove> Another reason not to do edits
09:06 <ottavio>   There's no /etc/ssh on the server, but it's running an embedded version of Linux.
09:07 <grawity>   glad you mentioned that
09:07 <ottavio>   probably dropbear, let me check
09:07 <grawity>   in that case it's most likely a different sshd than OpenSSH, and looking for the user keys in a different place
09:07 <grawity>   which means ssh-copy-id is useless against it

09:52 <richard_h> I've added /var/log/sitelogs/site for each site, and nginx is successfully creating files in there. But it creates them with different ownership (www-data:siteowner).
09:52 <richard_h> so if I let logrotate create the files, I think they will then be wrong. And if I create a separate logrotate config, nginx will get reloaded twice.
09:53 <richard_h> so my plan is to remove the create directive, and hopefully nginx will do the right thing by itself :-)

11:27 <rudi_s>    mangoginger: As I said, no idea what gnome-software is. But I'm guessing you're using Gnome so you cannot remove it.
11:28 <rudi_s>    Not that I know of. Detecting rootkits is very difficult so generic tools won't help much.

11:30 <mangoginger>   richard_h, synaptic could help fix the problem?
11:30 <richard_h> I don't know if there is a problem
11:31 <richard_h> but synaptic does similar things to gnome-software
11:31 <richard_h> as does apt, aptitude etc
11:31 <rudi_s>    mangoginger: Well, you won't catch any realistic ones with rkhunter IMO.
11:31 <mangoginger>   I have a sound issue and rkhunter show a suspect file..
11:31 <richard_h> so you certainly don't need gnome-software, but you might find it useful
11:31 <rudi_s>    Sure, because a root kit would tamper with your sound ...
11:32 <mangoginger>   rudi_s, what do you suggest I do in checking for rootkits etc Is there better software in checking this ?
11:32 <richard_h> rudi_s: who knows ... listening in could be a thing

11:33 <mangoginger>   rudi_s, would it make sense switching to another desktop like kde etc ?
11:33 <richard_h> you could try debsums (but read up on it yourself)
11:33 <richard_h> changing desktop seems extreme
11:33 <mangoginger>   richard_h, ok I'll look into that but not used it before...
11:34 <richard_h> but intrusion detection is inherently difficult, because an intruder can change the tools you're checking with ...
11:35 <mangoginger>   oh :o now that's a good trick that an intruder can do ...
11:35 <mangoginger>   Maybe just run a liveDVD of debian is safer than a hard disk installation of debian?
11:35 <rudi_s>    mangoginger: I suggest you don't worry about it. Use common security practices (good passwords, not running arbitrary code, e.g. curl | sudo sh, etc.) ..
11:36 <rudi_s>    *and be done with it. You cannot protect yourself from any possible attacker no matter how hard you try.
11:36 <mangoginger>   rudi_s, It sounds like a wipe of the installation is a good idea ?
11:37 <rudi_s>    mangoginger: Well, do what you want. But it won't do any good (most likely).
11:37 <rudi_s>    It's propably just a bug in the recent update. So either bisect it or look for other bug repots.
11:37 <mangoginger>   rudi_s, is there no way of detecting an intruder is on the box and get a warning telling me something is awry?
11:38 <rudi_s>    mangoginger: Against some intruders, sure. But there's no general solution.
11:39 <richard_h> I really wouldn't trust rkhunter very much.
11:39 <rudi_s>    But if you keep your software updated and don't go to shady websites, use a proper adblocker, proper passwords and so on, then a compromise is unlikely.
11:39 <rudi_s>    And rkhunter is like 10 years old or so.
11:39 <richard_h> But installing debsums and running 'debsums gnome-software' might give you some peace of mind
11:39 <rudi_s>    Sure, but it won't help against any half-serious attacker.
11:40 <mangoginger>   I am running Debian GNU/Linux bullseye/sid which should keep the software security up to date ?
11:40 <richard_h> there's no formal security updates for sid
11:40 <mangoginger>   richard_h, I'll try that now ...
11:40 <richard_h> if you want actual security updates, run stable
11:40 <rudi_s>    Testing is a little slower, but sid should get updates quickly. But as richard_h said no proper security updates (however, most of the time updates in sid are faster than the security updates in stable).
11:42 <mangoginger>   So a downgrade is possible instead of a wipe and start again ?
11:42 <richard_h> not supported
11:43 <mangoginger>   ahhh lol
11:44 <mangoginger>   richard_h, I just ran debsums gnome-software and all came back as ok ...
11:44 <richard_h> then I don't think I'd worry too much
11:45 <mangoginger>   What if I install boxes and installed stable debian that would have the security updates and a solution to the sound issues and the suspect file problem?

11:51 <richard_h> (intrusion detection tools)
11:52 <rudi_s>    mangoginger: What you're doing makes no sense at all. Stop guessing without understanding how the system works. If you don't know how it works you won't be able to find an attacker anyway.
11:52 <mangoginger>   richard_h, ok sounds like a mindfield of great tools to learn ... :)
11:52 <rudi_s>    And if you delete /dev/shm/PostgreSQL.858802425 you'll break your local postgres database ...

14:27 <grove> I have a machine with a zfs pool where `zpool status` list device names (i.e. sd[a-f] - the pool was made on FreeBSD and imported on Debian, so I haven't had much chance to control that). Now I want to put more disks in the machine (in time, to replace some of the disks in the pool), that might change device names (I don't control what order the cotroller presents the disks to Linux - or can I ...
14:28 <grove> ... do that in it's "BIOS", I have to check) do I need t take any precautions? (E.g. export the pool and import it when I've attached those new disks)

16:34 <superkuh>  I keep trying to edit gtkfilechooserwidget.c and gtkfilechooserwidget.ui from the debian 10 source and testing but the best I can get is for the location filename-entry bar to show up on first application gtkfilechooser widget use but not subsequent ones.
